Definition:
    The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern used to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
    It is particularly useful when working with a tree-like structure where each node can be an individual object or a collection of objects.

Problem:
    Imagine you're building a graphics editor application where the user can draw and manipulate simple shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines. 
    Over time, the application needs to support complex structures, such as grouping multiple shapes together and treating them as a single unit. 
    This way, users can apply transformations or move an entire group of shapes at once.

Solution:
    The Composite Design Pattern allows you to create a tree structure of objects where both individual objects (e.g., Circle, Rectangle) and 
    composite objects (CompoundShape containing multiple shapes) can be treated uniformly.

Use cases:
    1. Use the Composite pattern when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.
    2. Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.

Pros:
    1. You can work with complex tree structures more conveniently: use polymorphism and recursion to your advantage.
    2. Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new element types into the app without breaking the existing code, which now works with the object tree.

Cons:
    1. It might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much. In certain scenarios, youâ€™d need to overgeneralize the component interface, 
        making it harder to comprehend.
